DETECTION OF POKER HANDS WITH THE HELP OF REAL TIME OBJECT DETECTION
Detection of Poker Hands with Real-Time Object Detection leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) and OpenCV to identify and classify poker hands in real-time. This project utilizes YOLO for its fast and accurate object detection capabilities to recognize various poker hands from video streams or images. OpenCV is employed for image processing and manipulation tasks. The solution offers a robust approach to automatically detect and evaluate poker hands, enhancing gaming experiences and analysis.
